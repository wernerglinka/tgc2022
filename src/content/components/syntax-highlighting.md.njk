      Syntax Highlighting is done with a forked version of Metalsmith-Prism. The fork can be found [here](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-prism). As the name suggests this plugin uses [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) to do the work. In its current state, as of Jan 28, 2022,  it supports line numbers and all dependencies are up-to-date. To use it install it with 

      ```bash
      npm install git+https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-prism
      ```

      The plugin will be available on NPM soon.

      Use the plugin as usual

      ```javascript
        const prism = require('metalsmith-prism');

        ...
          .use(prism({
            lineNumbers: true,
            preLoad: ["java", "scala"]
          }))
        ...

      ```
      **The plugin will add all necessary hooks to the code so styles can be applied. Themes or styles are not applied by the plugin but with a style sheet at this point.**

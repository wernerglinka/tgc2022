quote: "Hereby we want to thank the Busse Design team for the outstanding job on the development and making this website a reality, including implementing the crazy 'never-been-there-before' design ideas and meeting our project timeline.

I want to thank, in particular, Werner for making the impossible possible. This site was a complex beast with a short implementation timeline. I appreciate that Werner joined in early in the project with advice, always thinking ahead -- while at the same time keeping a keen eye on the launch deadline.

We could not have done this without him!"

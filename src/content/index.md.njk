          The web is something I work on every day, and it's also something that deeply intrigues me. It's powering a myriad of changes in our own individual lives and is also behind huge shifts in economics, culture and politics. Simply amazing!

          I am a web developer, I build websites for established corporate clients and exciting new start-ups all over the world. I build static websites, use Wordpress and other CMSs. Typically I collaborate on projects with design companies in the role of technical expert and implementer to compliment their creative expertise.

          Besides my technical expertise I draw from extensive experience as an engineering, marketing, and business executive. I know how to work with people at all levels and how to deliver projects on time.

    title: How is this site build?
    prose: |-
      Gulp4 is used to process all assets first and then Metalsmith to build the site. Styles are written in SCSS and scripts in Javasript. 
      Content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and templates are coded with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/). 

      Swup is used for page transitions and page prefetching to provide the user with a smooth Single Page App (SPA) experience... or as much as one can do without actually building an SPA.

      Some implementation details to check out:
      - Page transition with [Swup](https://swup.js.org/).
      - Page backgrounds with [Gradien Magic](https://www.gradientmagic.com/) CSS.
      - Simple [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) icons.
      - Images hosted on [cloudinary.io](https://cloudinary.com/).
      - All images are loaded with Low Res Placeholders first and then replaced when the image enters the browser viewport (lazy load).

    prose: |-
      In their own words: "Think of swup as being pjax on steroids. The concepts are similar to those used in barba.js or other transition libraries, but swup gives more attention to ease of use and flexibility.
      Apart from loading the contents of the new page and replacing required parts in DOM, swup is built around CSS transition. The main thing that needs to be done is defining hidden state in CSS. Swup detects the end of transition of animated elements and proceeds to replacing the content of containers and animating your page back. For the animations based on CSS to be possible, swup uses several classes that are assigned to the html tag through the process of page transition."

    prose: |-
        CSS Gradients are fancy patterns created via CSS, primarily used to add color or patterns to a website. They have many benefits over images, including being easier to work with and much smaller in size.

        As long as you don't re-distribute or re-sell gradients or derived images from gradientmagic.com, you may use them on personal or commercial projects with attribution.

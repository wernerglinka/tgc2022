      Minneapolis is the project that aims to use WordPress as a headless CMS to feed structured content to [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/), a static site generator.

      WordPress, a widely popular content management system, boasts a user-friendly interface that simplifies content management for editors. By adopting WordPress as a headless CMS, we decouple the front-end presentation layer from the back-end content management system,  for increased flexibility and scalability.

      To retrieve content data efficiently from WordPress, we leverage the GraphQL API. GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, empowers us to request specific data and shape the response according to our exact needs. Compared to traditional REST APIs, GraphQL offers enhanced efficiency in retrieving data.

      Metalsmith, a versatile static site generator, enables us to transform and generate static websites from diverse sources. We'll construct a custom source plugin to integrate WordPress content into the static site generation process seamlessly. This plugin will fetch the content data from WordPress and convert it into Metalsmith file objects.

      By employing this configuration, we use the content management capabilities of WordPress while capitalizing on the performance and security advantages of a static website generated through Metalsmith.

      This project is similar to [Ruhrpott](/blog/ruhrpott-metalsmith-sanity-match-just-right/), which used [Sanity IO](https://www.sanity.io/) to feed content to Metalsmith. I'd recommend reading the Ruhrpott posts as well.

      On to the next post, where we'll review the [WordPress setup](/blog/minneapolis-wordpress-setup/).
